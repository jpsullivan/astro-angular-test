# Branch Deploys

Automatically deploy every branch for testing and collaboration.

## How It Works

1. Push to any branch
2. Automatic deployment triggered
3. Unique URL generated
4. Share with your team

## Benefits

- Test features in isolation
- Easy collaboration
- No conflicts with production
- Automatic cleanup of old branches

## Configuration

Enable branch deploys in your project settings:

```yaml
branch_deploy:
  enabled: true
  pattern: "feature/*"
  retention_days: 30
```
