# Protect Deploys

Learn how to secure and protect your deployments from unauthorized access and changes.

## Protection Methods

### Password Protection
Add password authentication to preview deployments.

### IP Allowlisting
Restrict access to specific IP addresses.

### Branch Protection
Prevent deployments from protected branches without approval.

### Deploy Keys
Use SSH keys for secure deployments.

## Configuration

```yaml
protection:
  password: true
  ip_allowlist:
    - "192.168.1.0/24"
    - "10.0.0.0/8"
  require_approval: true
  approvers:
    - "admin@example.com"
```

## Best Practices

- Always password-protect preview deploys
- Use environment-specific credentials
- Rotate deploy keys regularly
- Audit deployment logs
- Enable two-factor authentication
