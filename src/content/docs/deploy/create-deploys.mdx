## Deployment Methods

### Automatic Deploys
Triggered automatically when you push to your repository.

### Manual Deploys
Deploy on-demand from the dashboard or CLI.

### Scheduled Deploys

## CLI Commands

# Deploy current branch
npm run deploy

# Deploy specific branch
npm run deploy --branch=feature-x

# Deploy with custom config
npm run deploy --config=production
```

## Configuration

Set up your deployment pipeline in `.deploy.yml`:

```yaml
version: 1
build:
  command: npm run build
  output: dist/
deploy:
  region: us-east-1
  cdn: true
```
