# Request Chain

Learn how requests flow through the Angular Components system.

## Request Lifecycle

1. **Client Request** - User initiates an action
2. **Routing** - Angular router processes the request
3. **Component Loading** - Required components are loaded
4. **Data Fetching** - API calls are made if needed
5. **Rendering** - Component renders with data
6. **Response** - User sees the result

## Optimizing the Chain

- Implement request caching
- Use parallel data fetching
- Minimize API calls
- Optimize component load times
