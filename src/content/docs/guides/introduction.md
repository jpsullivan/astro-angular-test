## Overview

This documentation site showcases a collection of standalone Angular components built using the `@spartan-ng/brain` package. These components are designed to be accessible, customizable, and easy to integrate into your Angular applications.

## What is Spartan Brain?

`@spartan-ng/brain` provides unstyled, accessible component primitives for Angular applications. It focuses on functionality and accessibility, allowing you to apply your own styling while maintaining best practices.

## Integration with Astro

We use `@analogjs/astro-angular` to seamlessly integrate Angular components into this Astro Starlight documentation site. This allows us to provide live, interactive examples of each component.

## Getting Started

Browse the Components section in the sidebar to explore available components, see live examples, and learn how to use them in your projects.
